# Mining - Scheduling Ops

![PotashMine](/img/portfolio/potash_cory.jpg){:class="img-responsive center-block"}{:width=150}

Managing a network of mines is a complex operation, each mine with its own unique character, producing a range of products at various capacities, with varying amounts of space for
on-site inventory storage, often with processing facilities to refine products, and with unique transportation access and costs. 

The Potash Corporation, headquarted in the Province of Saskatchewan, has mines at locations around the world and supplies a global market for fertilizer and crop nutrients that are essential in modern agriculture. 

Scheduling of shut-downs and starts-up of each potash mine, and a variety of labour and fiscal constraints, can be a key step in determining the network operations. Ultimately the goal of a commercial mining operation is to maximize profits over a sustained period of time, taking into consideration the constraints of operation while responding to opportunities in the marketplace. The researchers at Potash Corp presented a challege to the participants of the 2015 PIMS Industrial Problem Solving Workshop, to come up with an effective software algorithm to aid in optimizing the operations of the mines. A key improvement was to provide feedback to the operators on how to adjust the algorithm on the fly, to provide useful and reliable results for real operations over a sustained period.
