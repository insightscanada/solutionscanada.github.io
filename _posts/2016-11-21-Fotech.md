# Oil & Gas - DAS

In current oil recovery technologies, fluid flow and fracturing processes can be
monitored with novel distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) devices built on fibre
optic cables that are embedded in a bore hole and interrogated with a
sophisticated laser emitter and detector system. The 2015 IPSW problem presented
for study by researchers at Fotech Inc. was to determine how single-component
sensor data can be used to provide information about fracture hypocentres.
Travel time, Eikonal equations, and least squares modelling of the data are
all used to improve the resolution of the sensing equipment.

This research collaboration has developed into an NSERC-funded internship,
applying novel signal processing algorithms to other DAS applications in
monitoring linear assets in the field.
