# Manufacturing - Michelin

The Michelin Tire Company requires the tires it produces to be very uniform in
order to provide a quiet, smooth ride for the automotive consumer. The more
uniform the tire, the quieter the ride and the more comfortable the road
experience. A modern automobile tire is constructed from twenty or more layers
of materials including an air-tight inner seal, layers of rubber, cords and
steel belts, bonding agents and finally a surface tread to complete the
assembly. The optimal alignment of layers and bonding components is critical to
the performance of the assembled tire. 

At a PIMS Industrial Problem Solving Workshop in Calgary, Alberta, Michelin
presented the problem of designing a rigorous testing procedure to guide the
construction and analysis of their tires to ensure the optimal layering of
components to give a uniform tire. With a team of mathematicians and
statisticians, a successful testing protocol was devised using advanced
techniques in harmonical analysis, statistical experimental design, and Monte
Carlo simulation. A second workshop at UBC extended the testing procedures to
include the method of Good Lattice Points, accounting for non-harmonic frequency
components in the tire non-uniformity, and optimally reducing select frequencies
that have a marked effect on consumer comfort experience.  

The company implemented this novel testing procedure into their factories and
reported savings in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.
