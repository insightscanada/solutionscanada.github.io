# Quantum gate design

![Qgate](/img/portfolio/QuantumGate.png){:class="img-responsive center-block"}{:width=150}

The heart of a quantum computer is a simple quantum gate that has several inputs
and outputs controlling a certain number of basic quanta of information known as
qubits. The research group at the Institute for Quantum Science and Technology,
led by Dr. Barry Sanders at the University of Calgary had developed a novel
machine learning method, known as Subspace-selective Self-adaptive Differential
Evolution, for creating the optimal design of a three qubit gate. Extending this
to more qubits is a major computational challenge, which the group presented as
a problem at the 2015 PIMS Industrial Problem Solving Workshop held at the
University of Saskatchewan.  A four qubit design leads to a hard optimization
problem in $$4^4 = 256$$  dimensions. A mathematical re-formulation of the
design problem led to an algorithmically simpler *feasible region* problem. The
result is a computationally efficient algorithm that solves the design in a
matter of hours of compute time, rather than weeks or months.
